# Spatial Benchmark
Spatial Benchmark can be used to test the performance of systems that deal with topological relations proposed in the state of the art DE-9IM (Dimensionally Extended nine Intersection
Model) model.

# Uploading Benchmark to HOBBIT Platform
Guidelines on how to upload a benchmark can be found here: https://github.com/hobbit-project/platform/wiki/Benchmark-your-system

# Running the Benchmark
If you want to run Spatial Benchmark, please follow the guidelines found here: https://github.com/hobbit-project/platform/wiki/Experiments

**Description of Spatial Benchmark parameters**:

* DE9IM Spatial Relation: All the pairs of traces generated will follow the selected relation.

* Output data format: Select a data format from the drop down list.

* Mimicking Algorithm Seed: The seed value for a mimicking algorithm. 

* Percentage of points to keep from source trace: one can restrict the number of points to consider due to the possibly very large number of points per Trace

* Population of generated data (number on instances)
